                <p>
                    Technotama LLC provides software development and technical support.
                    Drawing on experience with large-scale development and SDK development at major corporations, CTI/CRM service development at startups,
                    and supporting multiple companies as a contractor, we focus on quality and operational considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to new development, maintenance, and improvements, we also provide on-site technical support to identify issues,
                    from validation to deployment to adoption. We prioritize not just design on paper, but achieving a state where systems "work in the field" and "are actually used."
